About *Caenorhabditis elegans*
------------------------------

The nematode worm *Caenorhabditis elegans* has been a major model
organism for basic biomedical research for over 30 years. Genetic and
molecular research in *C.elegans* has played a key role in the
development of our understanding of many important processes, including
cell death, microRNAs and RNA interference, development, and aging. *C.
elegans* was the first animal whose genome was sequenced (C. elegans
Sequencing Consortium, 1998), and has been an exemplar in the
application of genomic data to functional biology in animals.

*C. elegans* is a small, free-living nematode found in decaying plant
material, especially compost and mushroom beds in temperate regions
throughout the world. It feeds on the bacteria and other microorganisms
associated with plant decay, and is frequently found associated with
snails, slugs, millipedes, mites and pill bugs, which are presumed to
transport worms from one location to another. The animal has a short
generation time, developing through four larval stages into an adult.
*C. elegans* is hermaphroditic and distinct from the majority of other
characterised nematodes which have both male and female adult animals.
